# Surgo ML-platform: accessing funding data
Access data from the World Bank and USAID and process it using this repository.

Data over the API includes projects that have not even started yet, and is up to date (e.g. a board meeting approval appeared <3 days on the API data).

A .csv is easier to work with initially though.
